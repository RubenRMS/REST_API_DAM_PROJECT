# REST_API_DAM_PROJECT
Api in PHP that was done for a class project

Project was about a car renting app, there was an Android and PC clients with which the API would communicate


May not be perfect but it's my first ever API done on my own, and hopefully may serve as guidance to someone else on how to make one.
